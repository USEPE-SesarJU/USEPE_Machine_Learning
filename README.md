# USEPE: Machine Learning 
USEPE project has introduced Density Dynamic Coridor Concept (in short D2-C2) method to improve safety and efficiency in U-Space. The D2-C2 method is tested through BlueSky - The Open Air Traffic Simulator. The collected data is visualized, analysed, and improved by well respected machine learning algorithms such as Neural Network, Random Forest, and Neural Network.

## Code structure
The python codes are collected in the functions folder. The python scripts are written with minimality aproach to provide easy to debug and improve.
<br>The input data and output data are in the data folder. Thus, simplicity is aimed.

## For feedback and sugestions
For any question or suggestion, we will be happy to provide support.
